# Bare Metal Embedded Systems Programming Journey

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository documenting my journey in bare metal embedded systems programming. I am [Your Name], a passionate learner eager to explore the intricacies of low-level programming for embedded systems.

## Learning Goals
My primary goals in this journey include:
- Understanding the fundamentals of bare metal programming.
- Exploring real-world applications and challenges in embedded systems.
- Building hands-on projects to solidify my knowledge.

## Roadmap
Here is a high-level roadmap of topics I plan to cover:
1. Introduction to Bare Metal Programming
2. Microcontroller Architecture and Memory Management
3. GPIO and Peripheral Control
4. Interrupts and Timers
5. Communication Protocols (I2C, SPI, UART)
6. Device Drivers and Firmware Development
7. Real-time Operating Systems (RTOS)
8. Embedded System Debugging and Optimization

## Resources
I will be using various resources to guide me through this learning journey. Some of the key resources include:
- Books
- Online Courses
  
## Progress Tracking
I will regularly update this README to track my progress, share insights, and document challenges and solutions encountered during the learning process.

## Projects
Explore the `projects` directory to find hands-on projects I've implemented in the course of my learning journey.

## Notes
Check the `notes` directory for detailed notes on specific topics, code snippets, and reflections.
